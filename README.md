# PreciseXY - version 2
Affordable and precise XY and Z movement platform for scientific experimentation, now in the second iteration.

At the moment files of the design are being completed and will be published shortly.

## X, Y gantry

This CNC gantry is based on [Core (X,Y)](www.corexy.com) project, to explore and design a stable and precise mechanism with minimal part count. Trolley for mounting Z axis is connected with two stepper motors over the system of pulleys with two timing belts, one for each motor which provide movements in X, Y directions. Because of the cross section mounting of timing belts, good horizontal stability is achieved. Also we can use only two stepper motors no matter the number of linear guides used without compromising structural strength and accuracy. Z axis enables modular usage and installation of various needed systems. With that, utilization of the gantry is increased.

## Z attachment
The Z axis is designed such that a number of different toolheads can be attached to it. The Z axis mount has 4 M3 holes suitable for mounting a custom designed and 3d printed bracket. Drawing for designing the mounts is displayed here:

## Upgrades from version 1
The overall design has been improved for stability, ease of manufacturing and reliable machining, the following key upgrades have been made.
 * Added a double carriage on Y axis
 * Added endswitches
 * Optimized idler wheel placement for more precise movement
 * Optimized cabling, all electronics placed on the head via a durable flexible cable
 * Designed a new precise Z stage
 * Optimised carriage assembly
 * Eliminated x to y axis error due to corexy movement mechanics
 * Modified the Z axis carriage for scientific instrument mounting.
