## X, Y gantry

This CNC gantry is based on [Core (X,Y)](www.corexy.com) project, to explore and design a stable and precise mechanism with minimal part count. Trolley for mounting Z axis is connected with two stepper motors over the system of pulleys with two timing belts, one for each motor which provide movements in X, Y directions. Because of the cross section mounting of timing belts, good horizontal stability is achieved. Also we can use only two stepper motors no matter the number of linear guides used without compromising structural strength and accuracy. Z axis enables modular usage and installation of various needed systems. With that, utilization of the gantry is increased.

Adopted system was upgraded with the following enhancements:

* Instead of using smooth rod with linear bearings, we used linear rails with carriage. Thus we reduce the number of support elements necessary for fastening guide system, and increase the precision of the movement in the X and Y direction.
* For the XY plane we're using the 350 mm long linear rails. With implementing useful construction solutions, the whole length of the linear rail can be used. That means 350X350mm of working area in XY plane minus the dimensions of trolley used for Z axis.
* We added tightners for fine precision settings for the timing belts.
* All the components are made out of  5 mm thick aluminium plate, and fixed by screwing.
* We added levelling legs that allow the stabilization on the surface.

These modifications allow us repeating accuracy better than 0.05 mm (in X and Y), and feed rates up to 1800mm/min.

## Future improvements:

* Double carriage system for X axis, to prevent unwanted diagonal movements
* Replacing belt drive with leadscrew, which will increase the accuracy of the positioning
